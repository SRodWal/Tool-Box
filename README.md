## Tool-Box
A collection of patches and small solutions

Objectives:

Collect all small programing solutions made during by learning process.
Mantain at easy access a multipurpuse solutions. Webscraping, file manipulation, models, codes simplifications

1. append_df_excel:

        a. Inputs: DataFrame, excel filename, sheet name in excel.

        b. Outputs: An excel file with a imported data.

        c. Possible upgrades: Accepting multiple dataframes and sheets. Benefits: Saves cuts time for opening the excel file.


2. DistributionFitting:
    This code will help to find a distribution density that better fits a data set. It requires scipy library and uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for each posible distribution.
    Scipy has over 90 possible continuous distributions (norm, skewnorm, burr, etc.) 
    
        a. Imputs: A data set, dataframe of array.
        
        b. Outputs: Indicates the must probable distribution density that fits the data set.
